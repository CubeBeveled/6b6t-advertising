# 6b6t advertiser
A bot to advertise your stuff on 6b6t<br>
*Only works with offline authentication accounts (cracked accounts)*

# Running the bot

You can do that by running the following inside the `src` folder from your console.

4. Modify the `config.json` file found inside the `src` folder. More specifically, the [messages](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/6b6t-advertising?tab=readme-ov-file#messages), [username](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/6b6t-advertising?tab=readme-ov-file#username) and [password](https://github.com/CubeBeveled/6b6t-advertising?tab=readme-ov-file#username).
